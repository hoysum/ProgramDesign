Your 6 year old client needs an application that will receive an integer from the user banging on the keyboard, add 5 to it, double it, subtract 7 from it, and display the result to the screen.

Pseudocode:
An application for 6 year old to enter number, add 5 to it, double it, subtract 7 from it and display. 

Algorithm:

	Input Integer
	Integer = Integer + 5 *2 -7
	Print Integer 



2. Add three numbers and print the total
His little sister now wants a program to read three numbers, add them together and print their total.

Pseudocode: Read 3 numbers, add them together and print total

Algorithm:
Do While

set count=0
do

	
	Input Integer   	
	count ++1
 
while (count  < 3 )
Print Integer
Print Total = Integer 1 + Integer 2 + Integer 3



3. Find the average score
Pseudocode: Prompt user for 10 exam scores, calculate average and display result to screen.

Algorithm:


For
set count=0
For count<10
Count = Count ++
	Input measurement
	Calculate average score  //Calculate average score
	Print average score

End For


4. How much water runs off the roof


Pseudocode: Prompt user to enter L and W, this answer will be x 12 then divided by 231
Algorithm:
To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. (So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).

	Input dimensions L
	Input dimensions W
	Input dimensions L x W	
	
	Convert dimensions L to Inch = L x 12  //Convert dimensions to inches 
	Convert dimensions W to Inch = W x 12  //Convert dimensions to inches 
	Calculate Formula L x W / 231
	Print
